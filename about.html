        <h2>About Cash Cards</h2>
        <p>A cash card is an electronic payment card that stores cash for various types of payments. Cash cards may include <br> bank debit cards, prepaid debit cards, gift cards, and payroll cards. <br>They do not include credit cards since credit cards
            are a form of debt rather than cash.</p>
        <p>Cards can be classified on the basis of their issuance, usage and payment by the card holder. <br>There are three types of cards: Debit Card, Credit Card and Prepaid Card.<br> These cards can be issued by banks or other entities too. We will discuss
            each type of card and the issuance authority for particular type of card.</p>
